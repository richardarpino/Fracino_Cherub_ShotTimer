# Project Philosophy

This project started from a simple place: a love for espresso and a desire to learn. It isn't just about code and circuits; it's about the joy of the journey.

## ☕ Passion First
This project was born out of a hobby and a passion for making better espresso. We do this because we love it.

## 🛠️ Learning as a Goal
At the start, we knew very little about electronics. This codebase is a living record of our learning. We embrace the "cracks" and the "battle scars" because they represent growth. If you don't know anything about electronics but want to learn, you are in the right place.

## 🌀 Iterative Joy (The "No Master Plan" Policy)
There is no "Phase 10" or a grand road-map. We follow where the ideas lead us.
*   **Explore & Think**: Emergent architectures and unexpected problems are exciting, not frustrating.
*   **Use & Tweak**: We get something working, we live with it, we use it to make coffee, and then we improve it.
*   **Never "Done"**: The project is a process of constant refinement. The goal is the iteration itself.

## 🤝 Sharing & Openness
We share our ideas and our knowledge because there is joy in it.
*   **Expect Nothing Back**: We share freely.
*   **Thinking of Others**: We write clean code, clear docs, and robust tests so that others can join in the exploration.
*   **Licensing**: We aren't sure of the final license yet, but we want this to be useful. If you can find a way to make money off this project, go for it—we'll probably be your first customer.

*“The goal is not to reach the end, but to enjoy the brew along the way.”*
